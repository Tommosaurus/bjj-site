        have classes to suit all. We recommend that anyone who is looking to

        at the academy that the atmosphere in the classes is one of learning in
        a friendly and cooperative environment. Bullying or any other form of
        attitude that is not conducive to a positive and safe environment for
        students to train in will not be tolerated. The academy rules will be
        shown to you before you take part in your first class. Thank you for

        us, that way you can have a look around, speak to myself or the staff
        and get a general feel of our academy. It is important to us that you
        get a good idea of not only what we teach, but also how we approach the
        martial arts we teach, as well as providing you with as much information
